# Employee Sorter

## Description
This application uses a random user api to simulate a list of employees at a company. The employees are sorted into a table with an image, name, email, and phone number column. The table can be searched with a search bar, which searches for both first and last names. The table can also be sorted alphabetically by first and last name.
